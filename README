Introduction

hogre is a Haskell FFI binding to a subset of OGRE (www.ogre3d.org).

License

hogre is licensed under MIT. OGRE is licensed under LGPL for versions before
1.7.0 and under MIT for 1.7.0 and later. See the OGRE website for more 
information.

Installation

1. Install OGRE and CEGUI C++ libraries on your system. Consult your OS on 
how to do this. For Debian and Debian-like Linuxes, something like 
"sudo aptitude install libogre-dev libceguiogre-dev libcegui-mk2-dev"
should do.

2. As hogre consists not only of Haskell code but also C++ code and a C
header in order to bind OGRE, you need not only a Haskell compiler but also
a C++ compiler which the Haskell compiler should use. Only GHC with GNU g++
has been tested, which seems to work without problems as long as both 
compilers are installed.

3. The usual cabal configure [--user] && cabal build && cabal install.

4. OGRE does only graphics; for input, audio, networking etc. you need
separate libraries. You're free to choose which (if any).

5. You may want to check out the hogre-examples package for some examples

Known issues and bugs

Currently there is no exception handling, which means incorrect use (e.g.
not calling init or trying to access a non-existing entity will lead to an
error report and crash. As long as nothing illegal is done, everything's fine.
I'm planning on adding exception handling.

hogre depends on CEGUI even though it is not being used at the moment; I'm
planning on removing this dependency.

I'm not quite sure how portable it is; it should work on any platform OGRE
runs on (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows), and should work on any Haskell compiler 
that does FFI and knows how to invoke a C++ compiler. That doesn't leave much
choice, I guess. It also shouldn't matter which C++ compiler is being used.

On my tests it seems that the file ogre.cfg is not allowed to exist when
initialising OGRE and letting OGRE create its own window, otherwise nothing
will be drawn. It seems to me this is an OGRE bug, though.

I don't really know why it works at all; apparently GHC figures out from the
file name extension that the C++ files should be compiled with a C++ compiler.
If you have some better way to do this, do let me know.
